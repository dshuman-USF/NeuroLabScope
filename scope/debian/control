Description: spike train display utility
 scope is a spike train analysis utility program to visualize the
 times of action potentials in simultaneously monitored neurons, other
 event timing pulse codes, and associated analog signal. The program
 can scan, edit, select and save sections of the files generated by a
 spike “sorting” system for subsequent analyses. The program provides
 traditional representations such as firing rate histograms and
 rectified and filtered (“integrated”) records, and has tools to add
 time marker “codes” and delete or select sections of the data for
 subsequent analysis (e.g., results from a particular stimulus
 protocol).
